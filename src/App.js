      <h5>OUR MISSION</h5>

      <h1> We exist to help creators<br></br>
        own their audience.
      </h1>
      <h6>
        We believe that social platforms are taking advantage of creators.<br></br>
        We want to change that and help creators fight back.

        <p>
          Building a career on social platforms is like building a home on someone else's land. While social
          platforms are great for discovering and reaching your audience,
          your goal as a creator should be to convert your followers into email or text
          message subscribers. Why? Look no further than TikTok. Almost overnight,
          millions of creative people almost lost their careers.
        </p>
        <p>If a platform removes your account, or their algorithm for distribution no longer
          favours you, are you prepared?</p>
        <p>
          If you want to build a career as a creator, your focus should be on building durable
          distribution channels. Without distribution, you have no business. So how can you
          build an audience that you actually own? With emails and phone numbers. These
          distribution channels are direct. Instead of going through some algorithm, when
          you share over email and text message, you know that your audience will see your
          content. Even better is the fact that you own these lists. Instagram removes your
          acount, you're ok. YouTube changes their algorithm, you're ok. You own your
          audience.
        </p>

        <p>
          We built Marico to make this process easy, fast, and effective. The traditional
          solution to this problem involves spending days building a website or hiring
          someone expensive to do it for you. But those days are gone. With Marico, you
          get a portfolio that is always up-to-date and converts visitors into email or text
          message subscribers. The best thing? It takes under 5 minutes to setup, and it
          automatically updates whenever you post new content anywhere online. We
          believe the best tools are the ones you don't even notice. Marico helps you build
          your own audience, without any hassle or time commitment. All you have to do is
          share your portfolio link with your audience, and we'll handle the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also create posts from within Marico and share them in just a few clicks
          to your portfolio, and to your email and text message subscribers. Since all of your
          content is already in Marico, creating content takes minutes, not hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          For too long, social platforms have taken advantage of creators. Fight back and
          build an audience that you own.
